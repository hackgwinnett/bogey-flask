  Bogey is a simple and reliable web app used to grade Hackathon projects.<br/>
  <br/>
</p>


<h4>Projects are ranked on the following [customizable] weights:</h4>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-fymr">Category</th>
    <th class="tg-fymr">Weight<br></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Creativity</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.05</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Appearance</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.05</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Complexity</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">0.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Efficiency</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">0.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Execution</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">0.3</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
  Judges can also rank projects based on a specific category listed above.<br/>
  The listed categories can be altered to suit the hackathon's needs.
